# Price-Prediction---Airbnb
# Deciphering Airbnb's price terrain and making predictions using the various features of New York's Airbnbs
The aim of this model is to predict the prices of Airbnb while exploring the hidden patterns that possibly affect the prices. It can assist Airbnb hosts in optimally pricing their properties by understanding which features influence prices. On the other hand, it can help guests make informed decisions by understanding if a property is overpriced or underpriced. It is very important for every business to provide their services at the most optimal prices in order to satisfy the customers at the most. Airbnb hosts want to set competitive prices that attract guests while maximizing their potential earnings. By accurately predicting rental prices, hosts can optimize their pricing strategies and adjust prices based on factors that influence demand and market conditions. This model will help hosts at Airbnb to take data-driven decisions in determining optimal rental prices.
